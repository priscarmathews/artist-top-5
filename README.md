# artist-top-5
using Spotify API, this cute page displays an artist + top 5 most popular tracks, along with a preview from Spotify embed player.


you will need to follow the directions of https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api in order to get the proper credentials to fetch data.  once you follow the steps, the client id and secret will be placed in its respective places in config.json. 

+ the code is not perfect, i'd like to fix the layout of the page however i still like it so far
+ note that sometimes the artist's picture may switch to another (since spotify provides more than one photo)
+ the indentations are all over the place

!! :D
